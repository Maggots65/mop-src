# Maggots' Overhauled Portraits
If you choose to disable the 3D Status portraits, you're greeted by crusty, old renders of the 9 classes, some are even from the beta of the game. Out of frustration, I decided to remake the outdated art assets of the classes.
## "Wait, so what does this do?"
It basically replaces the old, [crusty small pictures of the 9 classes, and replaces them with new, up to date counterparts rendered in SFM.](https://i.imgur.com/kYUXANC.jpg)
## "How does one install this?"
You can download the latest release here, and put it in your `tf\custom` folder.
## Does this work on sv_pure 1?
To a length, it does indeed work on `sv_pure 1` servers, but it's not persistent, so don't expect any miracles.
